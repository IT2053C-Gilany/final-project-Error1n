    "> - Source with a link: \n",
    "- Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset\n",
    "> - Fields: \n",
    "- Person ID, Gender, Age, Occupation, Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep, Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, BMI Category, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Daily Steps, Sleep Disorder\n",

    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you select this data set?\n",
    "> I selected this dataset for a few reasons\n",
    "- 13 diverse fields that would make for great visualizations \n",
    "- Large data set (300+ records)\n",
    "- I've used datasets from Kaggle before and have found it to be a great resource\n",

    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, what questions would you like to be able answer about this dataset.\n",
    "> This could include questions such as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between X and Y variables?\n",
    "> - What is the distribution of the variables?\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between the variables and the target?\n",
    ">   You will need to frame these questions in a way to show value to a stakeholder (i.e.why should we know about the relationship between X and Y variables?)\n",
    ">\n",
    "My questions to be answered:\n",
    "- What factors most influence sleep? For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do men or women experience better sleep health?\n",
    "- Do certain high stress careers imapct sleep health?\n",
    "- What is the correlation between BMI and sleep health?\n",
    "- What is the correlation between daily steps and sleep health?\n",
    "- What is the correlation between heart health and sleep health? \n",
    "- What is the correlation between stress and quality of sleep?\n",

    "\n",
    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Provide a few examples of what you plan to visualize to answer the questions you posed in the previous section. In this project, you will be producing 6-8 visualizations. You will also be producing an interactive chart using Plotly.\n",
    "> Think about what those visualization could be: what are the variables used in the charts? what insights do you hope to gain from them?\n",
    "> Potential visualization ideas:\n",
    "- Histogram showing distribution of sleep length\n",
    "- Scatter plot showing sleep length vs sleep quality\n",
    "- Heatmap(s) of health metrics including BMI, steps, physical activity vs sleep duration\n",
    "- Bar chart of stress level by occupation\n",
    "- Bar chart showing quality of sleep by occupation \n",
    "- Bar chart(s) showing sleep disorders by gender\n",
    "- Interactibe plotly chart showcasing occupation, stress, and quality of sleep\n"
